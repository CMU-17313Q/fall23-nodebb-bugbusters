    "The model demonstrates really good accuracy, correctly predicting 83.20% of instances on the test dataset. In the confusion matrix, the top-left quadrant (221) represents true negatives, indicating the model correctly identified individuals who are not good candidates. The bottom-right quadrant (195) corresponds to true positives, showing accurate predictions of good candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the top-right quadrant (42) signifies instances where the model incorrectly classified actual non-good candidates as good candidates (false positives). On the other hand, the bottom-left quadrant (42) represents instances where actual good candidates were incorrectly classified as non-good candidates (false negatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of false positives and false negatives suggests that the model may have room for improvement, particularly in distinguishing between good and non-good candidates. Fine-tuning the model parameters, increasing the dataset size, or exploring alternative algorithms might improve its ability in distinguishing between candidates. Despite its current performance, the model provides a solid foundation for more improvement to ensure reliable predictions in the future.\n"
